Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius.

It should then return c_temp.


Let’s test your function with a value of 100 Fahrenheit.

Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.
Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit.

It should then return f_temp.

Let’s test your function with a value of 0 Celsius.

Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the value of c_to_f with 0 as an input.


Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration.


Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration.

Save the result to a variable called train_force and print it out.

train_mass and train_acceleration have been defined for you at the top of script.py. Make sure to uncomment those lines before trying to use these variables.


Print the string “The GE train supplies X Newtons of force.”, with X replaced by train_force.

Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c.

c is a constant that is usually set to the speed of light, which is roughly 3 x 10^8. Set c to have a default value of 3*10**8.

get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared.

Test get_energy by using it on bomb_mass, with the default value of c. Save the result to a variable called bomb_energy.

bomb_mass has been defined for you at the top of script.py. Make sure to uncomment this line before trying to use bomb_mass.


Print the string “A 1kg bomb supplies X Joules.”, with X replaced by bomb_energy.
